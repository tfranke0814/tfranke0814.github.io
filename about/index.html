              <h2>Hello! I'm Tyson Franke</h2>
              <p>
                I'm a software engineer born and raised in Wisconsin. In the past, I have primarily focused on backend development and cloud development in GCP. I enjoy being being flexible and learning new things. Agentic, Game Dev, Frontend

              <p>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me reading, playing Magic: The Gathering, or {Some funny line with Civ 6 or something}

              <h3>My Journey</h3>
              <p>
                My interest in statistics was sparked by an experiment in AP Stats, weighing Sour Patch Kids to see just how much gummy we were actually getting as opposed what we expected. Upon graduating high school, this led me to pursue a Bachelors in Math and Data Science at UW-Madison. During my time at UW, I've had the chance to work on various research projects through LASER, Informatics Skunkworks (now WISCURDS), and MXM. I have also had the chance to work on various technical projects from hackathons to my time spent with the UW Tech Exploration Lab and the SAIL program. 
              </p>
              <p>My entrepreneurial journey started towards the end of my time at UW. My last semester I had joined the CS Nest program where I cofounded the venture PondPicks. While short-lived, it has taught me a lot of lessons and been a guiding point for my ongoing endeavors.</p>
