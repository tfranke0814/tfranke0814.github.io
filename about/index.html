              <h2>Hello! I'm Tyson Franke</h2>
              <p>
                I'm a passionate backend developer and AI enthusiast who loves
                creating innovative solutions and experimenting with novel
                technologies. I enjoy working with modern technologies and am
                always eager to learn new skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                With experience in both backend development and agentic
                software, I bring ideas to life through clean, efficient code
                and thoughtful design. I'm particularly interested in natural
                language processing, agentic workflows, and emerging
                technologies surrounding tech entrepreneurship.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies,
                playing trading card games, or enjoying outdoor activities. I
                believe in continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the
                latest industry trends.
              </p>

                My Journey
              </h3>
              <p>
                My journey into software development began with curiosity about
                how things work behind the scenes. What started as an interest
                in mathematics, led me to discover the world of programming and
                its potential to solve real-world problems. I gained an
                increasing interest in machine learning and artificial
                intelligence, which has shaped my career path.
              </p>

              <h3>
                What Drives Me
              </h3>
              <p>
                I'm driven by the challenge of solving complex problems and the
                satisfaction of creating something that makes a difference. From
                designing reliable backend systems to tuning performance and
                observability, I approach each project with dedication and
                attention to detail.
