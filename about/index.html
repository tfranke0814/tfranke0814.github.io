            <h2>Hello! I'm Tyson Franke</h2>
            <p>
              I'm a passionate backend developer and AI enthusiast who loves
              creating innovative solutions and experimenting with novel
              technologies. I enjoy working with modern technologies and am
              always eager to learn new skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              With experience in both backend development and agentic software,
              I bring ideas to life through clean, efficient code and thoughtful
              design. I'm particularly interested in natural language
              processing, agentic workflows, and emerging technologies
              surrounding tech entrepreneurship.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies,
              playing trading card games, or enjoying outdoor activities. I
              believe in continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the
              latest industry trends.
            </p>

              My Journey
            </h3>
            <p>
              My journey into software development began with curiosity about
              how things work behind the scenes. What started as an interest in
              mathematics, led me to discover the world of programming and its
              potential to solve real-world problems. I gained an increasing
              interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence, which
              has shaped my career path.
            </p>

              What Drives Me
            </h3>
            <p>
              I'm driven by the challenge of solving complex problems and the
              satisfaction of creating something that makes a difference. From
              designing reliable backend systems to tuning performance and
              observability, I approach each project with dedication and
              attention to detail.
