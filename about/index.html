              <h2>Hello! I'm Tyson Franke</h2>
              <p>
                I'm a software engineer born and raised in Wisconsin. In the
                past, I have primarily focused on backend development and cloud
                development in GCP. I have also had experience building agentic
                software and llm applications. In my free time I enjoy learning
                new technical skills, and am currently exploring more frontend
                and game development. When I'm not coding, you can find me
                reading, playing Magic: The Gathering, or learning more Spanish.

              <h3>My Journey</h3>
              <p>
                My interest in statistics was sparked by an experiment in AP
                Stats, weighing Sour Patch Kids to see just how much gummy we
                were actually getting as opposed what we expected. Upon
                graduating high school, this led me to pursue a Bachelors in
                Math and Data Science at UW-Madison. During my time at UW, I've
                had the chance to work on various research projects through
                LASER, Informatics Skunkworks (now WISCURDS), and MXM. I have
                also had the chance to work on various technical projects from
                hackathons to my time spent with the UW Tech Exploration Lab and
                the SAIL program.
              </p>
              <p>
                My entrepreneurial journey started towards the end of my time at
                UW. My last semester I had joined the CS Nest program where I
                cofounded the venture PondPicks. While short-lived, it has
                taught me a lot of lessons and been a guiding point for my
                ongoing endeavors.
