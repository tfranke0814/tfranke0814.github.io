          This was our project for the SAIL program in summer 2025 at
          UW-Madison. With the rapid growth in AI, we were tasked with building
          our own AI application. What's the most reasonable thing to get AI to
          do? Play a trading card game of course!
        </p>
        <p>
          We built an interface to simulate different board states for the game.
          From there you can interact with the chat agent to ask about the
          board. This can be general questions about the rules or next possible
          game actions. The complexity of this project arrises when providing
          the LLM context about the game. In other words, we were teaching it
          how to play the game.
        </p>

          My role in the project was primarily on the backend where I focused on
          agent orchestrastion and the FastAPI. I'm particularly happy about
          this project as it gave me the chance to work directly with the
          LangGraph framework, which I came into the summer really wanting to
          learn. While I've come to learn that this may not be the best use case
          for agents, it gave me experience with RAG, memory & state management,
          tools, and other related aspects.
