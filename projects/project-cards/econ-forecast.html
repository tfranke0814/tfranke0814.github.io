        <h3>Economic Forecast Analysis on Job Loser Variable</h3>
        <p>
          This was my final project for Econ 460: Economic Forecasting at UW-Madison during the Fall 2025 semester. With a seeming growth in uncertainty in the job market, I decided to forecast the proportion of job losers reltative to the unemployment rate over the next year (into 2026). Finishing up my undergrad at UW-Madison, this was of certain interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wrote Stata code to further analyze the data, and apply various techniques I have learned throughtout the course. I ended up with two different forecast models for the data, with the difference being on the assumption of stationarity. The final report, which can be found in the repo, goes into more detail about the process and interpretation of the results.
